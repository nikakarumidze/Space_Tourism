This is a mobile-first website about Space Tourism, with several pages.
Responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop.

Technologies used:
React, React Router, Context API (state management), Material UI (for design).

I liked Figma design of the website, but the main reason I built this was to bring lots of technologies into the complete website.

The next stop will be full e-commerce with Redux. :)
